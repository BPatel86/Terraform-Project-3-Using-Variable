# Terraform Project - Launching EC2 Instances Using Map and List Variables

This project demonstrates how to launch multiple EC2 instances in AWS using Terraform by leveraging **map** and **list** variables for instance types.

## 🛠️ What This Project Does

- **Creates two EC2 instances** in AWS:
  - One instance uses a **map variable** to select the instance type based on region.
  - The other instance uses a **list variable** to choose an instance type from a predefined list.

## 💻 Technologies Used

- **Terraform**
- **AWS EC2**
